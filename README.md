# hyperfeed-exp

My in-progress attempt at setting up [hyperfeed](https://github.com/poga/hyperfeed) as a fully-frontend blob of javascript via [rollup.js](rollupjs.org). I don't know if this will be possible, and nobody has tried it yet (to my knowledge).

## Details

I'm using [this template](https://github.com/jlengstorf/learn-rollup) and trying to adapt it to fit my needs. It's proving to be slow and painful due to the ungodly number of dependencies needed (because node), but interesting anyway.

**UPDATE**: I'm putting this on hold for now, as there is a _lot_ of stuff to sift through. My `node_mmodules` folder is currently taking up 202MB and that is a lot of places for things to go wrong. I do plan on comming back to this at some point though.
