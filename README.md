# hyperfeed-exp

My attempt at setting up [hyperfeed](https://github.com/poga/hyperfeed) as a fully-frontend blob of javascript via [rollup.js](rollupjs.org).

## Details

I'm using [this template](https://github.com/jlengstorf/learn-rollup) and trying to adapt it to fit my needs. It's proving to be slow and painful due to the ungodly number of dependencies needed (because node), but interesting anyway.
